# Flights

A quick project to analyse the best way to travel across
the globe. 

## Open Data

This repository exploits [OpenFlight data](http://openflights.org/data.html) 
as its only data source.

## Prerequisites

The project is built with `Scala`. All you need to compile and run 
the project is listed as follows:

- sbt, the [Scala Build Tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

The project itself is not specifically configured for any particular IDE, if
you like to use one you should install its appropriate sbt plugin globally
instead of adding it to every project you touch.

Simply run `sbt run` to compile and run the project.
